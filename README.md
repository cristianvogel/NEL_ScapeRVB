TO BUILD FROM SOURCE:

going to need to install the  dependencies, with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag:

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

and also put the KeyZy library in the `native` folder. For convenience, you can download the library from here: 

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-RCQ5WLJb1WLsBIBfCX6v8L8wG-cKnJA&usp=drive_fs

or direct from the KeyZy website: [www.keyzy.io](https://developer.keyzy.io/download-cpp-static-library)

Adapt `scripts/build-native.mjs` for your target platform and architecture, 
hopefully then  run the build script:

```
npm run build
```
